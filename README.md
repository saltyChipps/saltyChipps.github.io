## Welcome to saltyChipps website

I'm currently attempting to figure out how to display a text based game I made in python here. Why here? I'll (hopefully) be ably to hook up a database and get a signin/signup/saving progress system working (it's a long game). Also, this way I can display my code _so easily_



[Testing....Testing...](home.py)




**What you see below is just for me to remember markdown**







### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/saltyChipps/saltyChipps.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
