## Welcome to saltyChipps website

I'm currently attempting to figure out how to display a text based game I made in python here. Why here? I'll (hopefully) be ably to hook up a database and get a signin/signup/saving progress system working (it's a long game). Also, this way I can display my code _so easily_



**[Here's a link to my game](game/index.html)**


**What you see below is just for me to remember markdown**  

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
