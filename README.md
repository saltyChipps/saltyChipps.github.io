## Welcome to saltyChipps website

I'm currently attempting to figure out how to display a text based game I made in python here. Why here? I'll (hopefully) be ably to hook up a database and get a signin/signup/saving progress system working (it's a long game). Also, this way I can display my code _so easily_



[Link to home.html](home.html) <-- sort of works  
[Link to home.py](home.py) <-- _why does this try and download a file_

TEST
```python
print("text")
arr = ['thing1', 'thing2', 'thing3']
for item in arr:
  print(item)
```


**What you see below is just for me to remember markdown**
